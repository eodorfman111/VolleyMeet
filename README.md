Volleymeet is a simple web platform where volleyball players can create, join, and manage volleyball games. Whether you're setting up a casual beach game or an indoor tournament, Volleymeet helps you organize it quickly with an interactive map and easy-to-use event forms.

What I Used
React: For building the frontend and user interface.
Firebase Firestore: To store and manage event data in real-time.
Google Maps API: For allowing users to pick a location for their volleyball games by dropping a pin on a map.
Netlify: Used for hosting and continuous deployment of the app.
CSS3: For making the site responsive and giving it a clean look.
Volleymeet was built as a project to get hands-on with modern web development tools and APIs. It's hosted on Netlify, and Firebase handles the backend. The app lets users pick their event locations on a map, set skill levels, and track whoâ€™s attending. Perfect for volleyball lovers!
